## Description
LOPS the one-stop-shop for fashionable items for men.

LOPS collection includes stylish accessories such as bracelets, rings, and necklaces. LOPS also offer practical essentials like wallets, watches, and bags, as well as elegant hats to complete the set.

LOPS is built on a combination of powerful technologies.

For the back-end, the Django framework API and Simple JWT provide a secure and robust foundation for handling user authentication and managing data. On the front-end, React with Redux and TypeScript enable a dynamic and responsive user interface. Our database options include MySQL and SQLite3, with easy-to-follow instructions in the README.md file on how to switch between the two.



## Technologies
* Django: a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean design.

* Django REST framework: a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

* Simple JWT: a JSON Web Token authentication library for Django that simplifies secure user authentication.

* React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which enables fast and dynamic rendering of components.
* Redux: a state management library that allows for centralized management of application state.
* TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enabling better code organization and easier debugging.
* MySQL: a popular open-source relational database management system known for its scalability and performance.
* SQLite3: a lightweight and self-contained relational database management system that's ideal for smaller-scale projects.



## Features
LOPS provides an exceptional experience for both customers and staff.

For customers, the authentication system ensures secure access to their account, while the profile hall offers a range of options for managing personal information, addresses, reviews and orders. The intuitive categories and product pages make it easy to find and purchase items, with the added convenience of cart and wishlist functionality. PayPal checkout API further streamlines the checkout process, ensuring a smooth transaction from start to finish.

For staff, the admin hall provides comprehensive data management tools, with clear options for managing both users and products.

In the users section of the admin hall, staff members can easily manage all user accounts, with the ability to view and edit user profile data, including orders, reviews, and addresses. This provides valuable insights into user behavior and preferences, enabling staff to better tailor the shopping experience to meet customer needs.

In the products section, staff members have full control over product and category management. This includes the ability to view and edit all product and category data, as well as add and delete products and categories as needed. The comprehensive order management tools make it easy to track and fulfill orders, ensuring timely and efficient delivery of products to customers.
